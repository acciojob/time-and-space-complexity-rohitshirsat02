    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, describing how the execution time increases with input size. Optimizing time complexity makes code more <b>efficient</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses, including both input storage and auxiliary space. For example, using extra space for storing elements results in a space complexity of O(n).</p>
